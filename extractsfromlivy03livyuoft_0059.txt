V. THE CAMPAJGN. 45

monly of present time, bnt also of past time, especially with reference to
habit. It implies that the supposition (protasis) is imaginary, and
generally that the conclusion or apodosis is likewise, though this does
not logically follow.

1. 359. alii . . . bucculasque. Translate, ‘ Some fell to sharpening
their swords, others furbished their helmets and beavers.' 1 have
omitted ‘scutorum,’ as 1 cannot find that 'the ⁴buccula,‘ which means
the mouth-pieee os the helmet, is ever used of the shield.

l. 360. loricas. ‘Cuirass.’ ‘ Tergere,’ ‘ Scour.'

l. 363. sciret is inserted by Madvig, who contends (Ι) that ‘qui ’ is
not for ‘quis'3 (2) that ‘cerneret’ cannot be used sor ‘intelligeret,’ to
express a conclusion formed from objects seen. See note on l. 359, and
note that ‘sciret' is doing double duty as consecutive subjunctive and

l. 365. finituros. For those who died would finish the war as far as
they were concerned. The subject is not expressed; a construction
which the leamer should not imitate.

Perseus was still supported by the Illyrians, and, if either he or Gentius
had been an able general, Nasica and his 8,000 men must have been eut
to pieces. The heights over which they passed must have been insur-
mountable in the sace of a vigorous foe.

1. 366. solstitium. Used of the summer solstice; ‘ bruma' (¹brevis-
sima') of the winter. Translate, ‘After the passing of the summer
solstice.’

l. 369. aestum. ‘It was clear that by high noon the heat would
aggravate both the one and the other‚' i.e. ‘lassitudo’ and ⁶ sitis!

1. 371. utcumque, ‘under any conditions.’

1. 376. Ibi. ‘On the spot.' ‘Quantum,' cogn. acc. after ‘incres-
ceret'; supply ‘ tanto' as antecedent. ‘Incresceret,’ subj. because the
increase is put indefinitely.

1. 379. metarentur. ‘To select a situation for the fore-front of
the camp.’ This was done by the tribunes and centurions sent in
advance for that purpose. They began by placing a white flag sor the
