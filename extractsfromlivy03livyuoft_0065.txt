Vl. THE BATTLE OF PYDNA. 51

VI. THE BATTLE OF PYDNA. B.c. 168.

l. 547. Movebat. Invert this in translation. ‘ Men were stirred by
reverence for‚' &e It is to be regretted that Livy's sketch os Aemilius
here is partly lost' to us. This is obviously only a fragment.

1. 548. in parte praecipua. ‘ Taking a more than ordinary share,’
i. e. he was not content with ‘ pars virilis‚’ but wanted to do more than
his proper share.

1. 549. capessebat. The suffix expresses eager action.

Perseus had drawn up his army behind Pydna, with a deep mountain
torrent in front. Through the strip of coast-land a number of mountain
streams flow down Olympus and its contiguous mountains, parallel to
one another, into the sea. Behind eaehof these Perseus had made forti-
fications to resist the Romans, should they force Tempe. Publius
Nasica had however driven him to abandon these and retreat to Pydna. ’

Intervallum. We know from other sources that the phalanges
of the enemy had been much scattered previously by the flight of the
Roman vanguard, whom they had pursued too eagerly. Livy omits all
mention of this.

l. 550. cetratos. ‘ Peltasts.’ The Phalanx was originally a compact
parallelogram of fifty men abreast and sixteen deep. Before. the time of
Philip, however, it had become a general expression for any large body
of Greek troops. In his time the corps, called Phalanx, consisted of
16,000 men, divided into four equal parts. When drawn up for battle
it formed two grand divisions, each divided into two sections, with the
worst troops in the centre sections.

1. 551. The position then was like this—2

Macedonian Cetrati.

Roman Tergum legionis.

Roman Frons legionis.
Macedonian Clipeati or Phalanx.

This is evidently what Livy means to describe as the position.
Whether in his desire to be vivid he has not overstated his case, and
described Aemilius as exposing his troops to a double ⁴ fire,’ it is hard
to say. Mommsen, after describing the retreat of the legions to a hill
near the Roman camp, goes on to say, ‘Here the fortune of the day
changed. The uneven ground and the hurried pursuit had disordered
the ranks of the phalanx; the Romans, in single eohorts, entered at every
gap, and attacked it on the flanks and in the rear.' This is Plutarch’s
account (Vit. Aem. xx), who specially adds—w) μίαν πρὸς ἅπαντας, ἀλλὰ
πολλὰς καῖ μεμιγμένας τὰς μάχας τίθεσθαι.

l. 552· habebat, i. e. ‘ legio? The legion entering at the gap between
