II. A FEW TRAJTS OF KING PERSEUS. 35

1. 138. super stantes. If these are taken as two words, translate,
‘ When the armed men had taken their place above the standing rank of
the squares,’ i. e. at the edge nearest the walls. If ‘ superstantes ' is read,
translate, ‘When those standing above in arms had approached the
walls,‘ &c. ‘ Supersto’ is used absolutely in Livy x. 5.

fastigio altitudinis. ‘ Highest point.’

l. 139. duorum signorum milites. The company of soldiers be—
longing to one signum was called a manipulus, since the ‘signum ' was
only a handful of straw.

l. 141. extremi. The last onesy i.e. ‘Those only who were on the
edges either in front or on the flanks.’

l. 144. testudini. ‘The darts which lighted on the tortoise went
gliding harnilessly right down the slippery decline like rain water
(on a roof).’

1. 145. Some decisive step was necessary now. The Greeks seeing the
Romans at their highest point of glory expected every year that they
had gone sar enough to provoke the jealousy of the godS‚ and, like their
own states in Greece, would fall. The Rhodians began to assert their
independence. Antiochus availed himself of the opportunity to seize
Egypt. Even the faithful Eumenes’ loyalty was supposed to be wavering.
If the republic could not find some year-officer more successful than
Philippus, their system stood condemned.

l. 150. prospectos . . . habere. ‘ Had procured.' A circumlocution,
meaning little more than ‘prospexisse,’ like ἔχειν in Greek with the
active participle. Compare ‘innumerabilia quae collecta habent Stoici)

1. 15¹· ut. ‘On condition that.'

l. 158. locavit.⁴ ‘ Contracted for the supply οἱ)

ΙΙ. A FEW TRAITS OF KING PERSEUS. B.c. 169.

1. 161. mallet. ‘Would have preferred.' Others read ‘malle‚' an
infinitive used predicatively. But compare ‘ Alias si Alexander gentes
adiunxisset, impedimentum magis quam auxilium traheret‚’ where the
imperfect is used to express a continuing state now no longer possible.

obtemperatum esse. Impersonal. ‘ T hat his commands had
not been obeyed.’ This refers to 1. 87.

l. 162. cum. Purely temporal: hence the indicative ‘iusserat.' In
this sense ‘ cum ' is generally preceded by ‘tum.’ Latin Grammar, ξ 21 2.

l. 164. id ipsum, like ‘id qu0d‚' usually in apposition to a clause;
here, to a verbal notion, such as ⁶ ut paenitentia regis animum subiret'
contained in the word ‘paenitentiae.' Translate, ‘ Leaving the king
some chance of altering his mind, as in fact it fell out.'
