of Eumenes, looked upon this monarch as the champion of Greece. He
himself was a son—in—law of Antiochus of Syria: his sister had
married Prusias, the King of Bithynia. The Rhodians were well
affected towards him and secret goodwill might easily blossom out
into open alliance, and so secure sor his service the finest fleet in
the Aegean. All Greece expected the speedy downfall of the Romans.
Accustomed to the sudden falls of their own states, they naturally
expected that the Romans had reached a point of glory beyond
which the gods would hardly let them advance. And so it carne to pass
that they were most insolent at a time when the power of Rome was most
able to crush thern, just as most exasperation against the dominion
of the French was manifested in Germany at a time when the French
were most able and ready to revenge it. In vain did men like Eumenes of
Pergamus, Charops of Epirus, Kallikrates of the Achaean league, warn
their countrymen of their weakness. Every one was now agreed that
the most detestable Macedonian hegemony was better than a govern-
ment imposed by foreigners‚ however disinterested, which the Romans
were not. The two nationalities were antagonistic; the sends were
srnouldcring3 any spark might kindle the open flame. So much had
Perseus’ snbtle plan brought ab0ut; he had placed all Greeee in a
state of eager expectance; he had amassed vast treasures; he had
organised great forces. But when the decisive moment arrived for
action, he failed; he shrank back from what he himself had taken in
hand: he wanted the genius to let slip his forces, to use his means,
to relax his grasp of his golden pieces. So it was that when in 172
Eumenes came to the senate with a list os his grievances against the
national Greek party, and the senate suddenly resolved on war,
I'erseus had not the spirit to forget himself and assume the leader-
ship of Greece. In 171 the Roman legions landed in Greece, and
under Publius Licinius Crassus invaded Thessaly. Though Perseus
was alone, he began the war with immense resourceS. Independently
of his allies, he had a force of 40,000 soot. It is therefore not sur-
prising that he should have led off with two victories‚ and does not
argue any very great want of political foresight that he thought he
could 'ln-ing the great republic to ternis. The iron rule of the
Romans never to make terms except with the vanquished was not
yet known to be applied to the states outside Italy. When therefore
the Romans rejected all compromise and resolutely continued the
war, the king was amazed. He had made his plans sor a defensive
war: and the Romans were waiting sor him to assume the offensive.
