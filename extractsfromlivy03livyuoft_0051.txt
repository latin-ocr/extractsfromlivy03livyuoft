II. A FEW TRAITS OF KING PERSEUS. 37

arises from a subject and object in the accusative with the same
infinitive. See Potts' Hints, p. 38, and compare the oracular answer
‘Aio te, Aeacida, Romanos vincere posse.² The ambiguity is avoided
by an ablative and a passive verb.

1. 190. patrem, Philip.

l. 193. Prusiam, king of Bithynia.

l. 194. Asiam. Here used for North Asia Minor, the kingdom of
Pergamus.

1. 195. liberandi. In all cases, except aster a preposition, the choice
between the ger-und and its govemed accusative or the gerundive
attraction seems determined by sound and clearness of sense, at the
choice of the writer. Cicero and Caesar generally prefer the gerundive.

suam. Notice how ‘suum' (l. 191), ‘ suam’ (1. 195) and ‘ secum'
(l. 199) illustrate the use of the reflexives. Latin Grammar, p. 489.

l. 196. fecerint. Note the transition from the historic construction
to the primary. It has the same effect as the historic present in direct
speech.

l. 197. Antiochum . . . arceri. Translate, ‘Even now Antiochus,
conqueror though he be, is kept off Egypt, which ought to be the
recompense of his war.’ The Rhodian fleet had but lately escorted the
Syrian bride of Perseus, daughter of King Antiochus, to Macedon. But

The argument ‘natura inimica,’ &c., was of more avail than twenty
marriages. The Antiochus referred to is Antiochus Epiphanes, who had
just begun to besiege Alexandria in 168 B.C., when the Romans bade
him desist. We hear of him in the Maccabees as a wicked root,
son of Antiochus the king, who had been a hostage at Rome.

l. 202. pecuniae. Eumenes had demanded 1000 talents as the price
of neutrality, 1500 as the price of procuring peace with the Romans.

1. 203. utique. ‘ Anyhow.' For this use of ‘ que ¹ compare ‘ ubique,
quandoque.’

alteram . . . impensam. ‘ One of the two sums named, said he,
was a base consideration between princes of so great a name, unfitting
the giver and still more the receiver3 however, for the hope of peace
he did not refuse some outlay.’ ‘ Alteram ’ is here contrasted with the
sum to be paid ‘in spem pacis)

l. ²07· Ea insula. Note the position of the subject as referring to
an object in the preceding sentence. Translate, ‘ This island being,' &c.
The island is in the Aegean, opposite the mouth of the Hebrus, and was
the seat of the worship of the Cabiri.

l. 208. videre. The historic infinitive is not only used where actions
and emotions follow in rapid successim, but where a state of things has
