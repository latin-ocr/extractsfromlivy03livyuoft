28 NOTES.

1. 6. Eumenen. Son of Attalus, and king of Pergamus. The
attempt at assassinating the king at Delphi was the pretext which
the Romans gave sor the war.

l. S. ea omnia. Translate ‘ He said he would find one day by the
issue of his soitune how odious all these dealings of his were in the
sight os the gods also (as well as in theirs).’ The clause is governed by
the idea of saying in ‘ adiecit.'

l. 10. pietati. ⁶ Dutisul feeling‚' as shown towards one's family;
‘ fidei ' as shown towards ‘ socias urbes? ‘ For the gods are ever
savourable to ‹iuteous feeling and good saith.'

quae. · Pietas' and ‘ fides’ are both non—sentient things, and of
the same gendes: hence ‘quae' might have been ‘quas' In cases
where the gendcrs vary, the attribute is almost always neuter. Compare
‘ Ira et avaritia imperio potentiora erant,’ and ‘ fortuna et maiestas, quae
si paria essent‚’ &c.

1. 11. fastigii. ‘ Such a pitch of suecess.'

iam . . . conplectentis. ‘Which already compassed the round
world.'

l. 13. Quanto. ‘How sar greater, he asked, was the strength of
Philip and Antiochus, and yet it was broken by no greater power than
the Romans now could show.’

l. 14. Philippi. Late king of Macedonia.

Antiochi. Late king of Syria, who had been defeated by the army
of Scipio Asiaticus in the battle of Magnesia, B.C. 190, twenty years
before.

fractas esse. Questions in a speech reported obliquely, which
are practically statenients and do not require an answer‚ commonly
have the infinitive mood. This is really an exclamation, or statement
equivalent to ‘ multo maiores‘ διε. Cacsar generally throws such
questions into the subjunctive, like those which really expect an answer.
ln instances like ‘ Quis hoc sibi persuaderet ? ' in Caesar, ὅ persuaderet'
stands obliquely, not sor ‘ persuadet‚' but for ⁴ persuadeat.‘

l. 16. placuit. ⁴ It was resolved not to make a longer stay in Thessaly,
and there to waste time, but preseutly to break up camp and remove
torthwith into Macedonia? Marcius Philippus' rashness in Liguria has
been already noted. As accident saved him then, so Perseus* incapacity
savcs him now,

l. 19. invehatur. With (lat. ‘blockade‚' with acc. ‘ attack.' Notice
the present for ‘ inveheretur‚' a poetic variation from the law ot sequence.

Praetore. G. Marcius, who had come from Chalcis to attend the
council.

l. 20. menstruum. I have introduced in the text ‘ frumentum.’
⁶ A month‘s provisions.' But Seneca says ‘ diurnum accipere' of slaves.
