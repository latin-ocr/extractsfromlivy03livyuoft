I. THE THIRD YEAR OF THE WAR. 33.υ

1. 98. quae utraque, se. Dium and Tempe.

1. 101. ea, se. Tempe, governed by ‘ pervehendis.’ Others understand
‘via.’

l. 103. Tempe. Livy here describes strategically the deme» which
Greek poets never weary of singing, which indeed from its extraordinary
beauty has given its name to all defiles. Whether we believe that
Neptune struck the rock with his trident, to let the waters of the plains
of Thessaly find a passage through the fissure; or that the giants in
their war with the gods uprooted the mountain Ossa on the north to pile
it on Pelion; or, finally, that the hero of the land, Peleus, was peacefully
united to the goddess of the sea, Thetis, on a neighbouring mountain;
in either case round this cut (Tempe) centres the main geological interest
of the neighbourhood. It is a narrow rocky defile, five miles long, in
which there is sometimes room only for the river Peneus and the
caravan to travel side by side. The ledge of rock is only four feet
in breadth in places, and has been surrowed by the wheels of military
waggons, ever since Longinus, Julius Caesar’s marshal, did for it what
Napoleon did for the Simplon. Through here it was too that Pompey
aster Pharsalia rode rapidly from the field of batt1e3 in this glen
he checked his horse and quenehed his thirst with water from the
Peneus.

etiamsi. ‘Even without any force of arms to make it actively
dangerous.' In 1. 108 it is called ⁶ suapte natura infestus?

1. 104. transitu. Supine in ‘u‚' or, in other words an ablative ot
fourth deelension (of respect). See the Latin Primer‚ ξ 141.

difficilis agrees with ‘ saltus‚’ ‘ sunt ’ with ‘ Tempe,' a Greek plural
norm.

1. 106. despici. ‘ A man can hardly look down but his eyes will
swim and his brain reel.'

l. 110. fuit. ‘ Was at that time occupied.’ The perf. participle used
with ‘sum‘ expresses that something was and is complete; with
‘sui ’ that something was complete at some past time ; e. g. ‘leges latae
sunt‚’ but ‘promulgatae fuerunt.'

Even the voluntary retreat of Perseus had not rescued the consul
from his painful position. He advaneed, it is true, as far as the
river Ascordus, but he was obliged after four days' march to turn
back sor want of provisions3 and when the king suddenly returned,
the Roman army would have been in great danger had not the im-
pregnable Tempe surrendered at the right moment and so secured
his communication with Thessaly. After this he felt strong enough
to attack Heracleum.

1. 111. admoveret. Subjunctive, because the act of marching his
men up was at that time only eonceived by him. Cf. 1. 69.
