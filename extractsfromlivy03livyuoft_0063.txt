V. JJJE CAMPAJGN. 49

how the Latin language avoids the verbal substantive. So ‘ Labeo
was charged with the maladministralion of the province‚' would be
‘ arguebatur male administratae provinciae.' l. 27, and l. 185.

l. 456. tantum abest, ut. The first ‘ut' clause is subject to ‘abest ⁷:
the second is adverbial and consecutive. Translate, ‘So far am 1 srom
repenting.' Yet, though in English we say ‘I am far‚’ in Latin they
say, ‘my repenting is sar,' hence ‘abest' In both languages we can
omit the conjunction. ‘So far from repenting, Ι believe.’ The Latin
in that case has the indicative, with ‘vix ' or ‘ etiam) Cic. Brut. 80.

l. 457. In qua. . . . ne. ‘And lest any . . . in this.’ Note the position
os ‘ me?

l. 459. The use os age in the second person, with ‘recognoscat ’ in
the third, is scarcely more curious than the use of ‘age ' with the plural,
e. g. ⁸age, considerate) For this use of ‘ dum ' compare ‘ mane dum,‘
‘ stay a bit '3 ‘ sac dum,’ ‘ do now'; ‘dudum‚ nedum, vixdum, interdum!

l. 462. vestrum. Gen. plur„ used in a partitive sense, originally
gen. plur. of ‘ vester (vestrorum),' here of ‘ vos.’

l. 465. ignavissimum quemque . . . scitis. ‘ You know it is not
the greatest cowards that are lest in charge.‘

1. 466. fuerimus omnes. Either ‘grant that we (the three-fourths)
were then the whole body‚’ or ‘grant that our whole body was there ’
For the mood compare ‘feeerit aliquid Philippus, quid Perseus meruit)

l. 469. summum. Used adverbially. ‘At the farthest.'

1. 471. requietum. See note to l. 38.

l. 478. comparatus. There seems to be no idea of matching in this
word here. ‘ Coniparo me ad iter, dux comparat milites‚' are common
expressions. Translate, ‘In such condition.'

1. 479. Quid, quod. ‘ Moreoverff

1. 481. nobis opposed to ‘hostes' ‘Whereas we should have been
suddenly forced to change on the spot into fighting formation with
all the attendant confusion, and to advance to the charge in imperl‘ect
order!

l. 483. At, hercule. Not, as often, an imagined objection os an
opponent, but an objection of the speaker. It sums up here the previous
sentences; ‘ castra munita‚’ &c., is opposed to ‘aciem quidem' and
passes to another point, and asks which of two states os things would
have been the case. ‘ Nostri ’ like ‘ nihil reliqui‚' ‘ nothing of our
own! If we read ‘ habentes,' we must understand something like
‘pugnavissernusf helped out by ‘ pugnaremus.' The final answer to the
alternative question appears in ‘ sine ulla sede‚' l. 498. The text here is
uncertain. It has been proposed to read ‘habuissemus ’ for ‘ habentes?

l. 491. quod with ‘ haberetur,' subjunctive. ¹ Because in their
opinion.'
