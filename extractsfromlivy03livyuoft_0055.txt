 

III. L. AEMILIUS PAULUS. 41

1. 262. When spero signifies hope or 'belief as to the present, it
follows that it need not have a future infinitive with it.

adfuturos, Compare ‘Adsis‚ O Tegeaee, favens,’ Virg. Georg.
i. 18.

l. 263. ominari. Translate, ‘In these things I am led partly by
presentiment, partly by hope‚' διο. Compare ‘naves velut ominatae,'
Liv. xxix. 3.

illud, as usual, refers to what follows, cf. 1. 172.

l. 265. ne . . . conceperitis, ¹ That you shall not have conceived.’ In
Latin the future exact of the conjunctive so resembles the perfect, that
the past only is notieed in the action, and the suturity is left to be
ascertained by the leading proposition. Compare ⁴ Facile egestatem se
laturum putat si hac suspicione sit liberatus.' Cic. Rosc. 128.

l. 266. et· . . . et. ‘ Both . . . and.'

1. 267. placet, sc. ‘ senatui,' as opposed to ‘ ego!

in mora. Compare ‘ne in mora illi sis‚' ‘ Do not hinder him.’

1. 269. gesturus esset. Latin Grammm, p. 482. The true apodosis
is a suppressed ‘present unfulfilled' conjunctive (pararet).

l. 271. credatis rogo = ‘ rogo ut credatis.’

alatis. Some read ‘ne’ omitting ‘rogo‚' instead of ‘neve' But
it is most unusual sor the second person of the present conjunctive to
be used with ‘ne’ prohibitive‚ except when addressed to an assumed
subject. Thus ‘ne quaeras’ should mean ‘One should not inquire’;
‘tu ne quaesieris, ‘Do not you inquire.’ In Hor. Od. i. 33. 1, ‘ Albi,
ne doleas,’ it may be understood as meaning ‘ to prevent your grieving
(consider how . . .),’ and so in other passages.

For alo used in the sense of promoting rumours, compare Livy
xxviii. 24, ‘Insita hominibus libido alendi de industria rumores.’ So
too Virg. Aen. iv. 2, of Dido in love, ‘'Vulnus alit venis.’

1. ²7²· nunc quidem . . . possit. ‘ Nowadays verily there is none
that sets so little store by common report as not to be capable of being
demornlized thereby.' Notice ‘cuius non.' ‘Quin' is rarely used as
containing any case of the relative except nominative or ablative. Thus
‘nego in Sicilia ullam fuisse picturam quin Verres conquisiverit’ (Cic.
Verr. iv. 1), where ‘ quin ' stands for ‘ quam non‚' is exceptional.

1. 273. debilitari. ‘ debilis'=‘de-habssis.'

l. 274· circulis. ‘Chance gatherings,’ as at cases, in the streets round
newsvendors or popular singers, at barbers' shops, &c.

si dis placet. ‘Please the gods, forsooth, good gracions‚ if you
please.’ Compare Cic. de Or. iii. 24, ‘Etiam Latini, si dis placet,
dicendi magistri exstiterunt.’ See Latin Grammar, § 220.

l. 275. conviviis. Compare ‘ In conviviis rodunt, in circulis velli—
cant’ (Cic. Balb. 26).
