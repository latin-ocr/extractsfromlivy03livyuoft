INTROD υοΤιοΝ. vii

The prospect of the outlay necessary for such an effort was too
much for him. He waited near his base and lest the Romans to
storm the cities os Haliartus and Coronea, whose only offence was
that they were loyal. So the campaign closed for the year 171 ac„
and the elections of the following year sent a ve1y different man,
Aulus Hostilius to the command of their army. For a year the
legionaries had to submit to the enforcement of stern discipline by a
man of no great mark in the military world. The abuses in the
army were corrected as far as could be done by a general who was
constantly urging precept without example. Whole nations and cities
were subjected to the grossest outrages to enrich the commander,
whilst the common soldiers were punished severely for the least
breach ot discipline. Incompetence had been succeeded by selfish-
ness; the man was still wanting to carry out the great republie’s
work. Eumenes and his Greek and Asiatic allies might well begin
to think that Spartan harmosts and Macedonian marshals were better
than Roman consuls, so long as neither possessed the gentleness of
a Flamininus or the moral purity of a Fabricius. The political success
of Rome in the East had been based on the general belief in her
incorruptibility; when that sailed, a corrupt Greek government might
well be preferred by Greeks. That was not too great a strain on
Greek patriotisrn.

The third year of the war had now come, and the Roman bur-
gesses this time chose an enterprising man, who was evidently no
great officer. Q. Marcius Philippus found the army in good condition,
clamouring for some achievement. His march across Olympus by
the pass of Lapathus was only successful because Perseus was so
inert. What cared the King of Macedonia for Olympus so long as
his money-bags were in Pydna or Pella? The result was that a
Roman army occupied Olympus without a battle, and Zeus was taken
captive by Jupiter. From that moment the Greek gods deserted
Perseus and joined themselves to the Roman legions. Marcius
Philippus had placed his army in a position where, in spite of
Perseus, they must die or fight. With the mountains at their back
they could not expect to draw enough provisions for long through
the pass of Tempe. They must move forward; and now that the
time for action had obviously come, the Roman burgess-electors were
sufficiently roused to send the right man. As always happened in
the time of danger, all political interests gave way to military ne-
cessities. In that marvellously elastic constitution, the change from
