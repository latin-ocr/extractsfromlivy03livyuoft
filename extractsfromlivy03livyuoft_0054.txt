the consuls ‘to be able to fix this great festival of the Latin alliance
so as best to suit political exigencies.

l. 250. primo quoque tempore. Translate, ‘On the earliest day
possible.’

possent. inissent. Subjunctives representing the ‘ poterunt' and
‘inierint' of the resolution (‘ placuit').

l. 253. duas iurisdictiones. It was part of the Roman policy with
a view to keep up the importance of the public magistracies to add
to the number as little as possible. The most urgent cases of necessity
were barely met by the division of the judicial functions at one time
exercised by a single praetor between two judges‚ one of whom judged
the lawsuits between Roman burgesses‚ the other those between non-
burgesses or between burgess and non-burgess. This division took
place in 243 B.C.‚ and there were nominated afterwards four auxiliary
consuls sor the four transmarine provinces, Sicily, Sardinia (227 B.C.)‚
and the two Spains (197 B.C.).

in urbo, ‘urbanus' would be more usual. Greek, having the
article, employs this idiom, where Latin uses an adjective or relative
clause. Cf. however ‘servus a manu‚’ ‘a secretary’ 3 ‘ Magnetes a Sipylo '
(Tacitusk διο. Cf. l. 259 ‘ in Macedonia‚’ which, however, is perhaps
preferably to be regarded as part of the relative clause.

l. 254. provinciae originally denoted not a definite space assigned
as a district to a standing magistrate, but simply the functions pre-
scribed for the particular magistrate by (lecree. The acquisition of
Corsica and Sicily introduced a new kind of administration. Hitherto
the two chief magistrates or consuls had no legal limit to their field
of aetion ; now there was a special auxiliary consul appointed sor each
transmarine division or provincia as it was called.

l. 255. Aemilio. L. Aemilius Paulus, son of the hero of Cannae,
had been consul in 181 B. C.‚ and had commanded as praetor against the
Lusitani in Spain.

Licinio. C. Licinius Crassus.

l. 256. sortito. ‘Now that Ι have drawn by lot.' What Aemilius
means is that they are more pleased at his drawing Macedonia as his
province by lot than they were at his being elected consul; the reason
being partly that he was eminently suited for the task and partly that
the appointment was beyond their own control. ‘ Deos quoque.’ Pro-
vidence as well approved of his appointment and had influeuced the lot.

l. 258. sum. So Madvig sor ‘essem.’ And rightly: sor ‘cum ³ with
the subjunctive denotes the succession of events; with the indicative it
is referred to a certain time.

l. 261. Deos . . . esse. ‘I have good hope that, as the gods . . .
so they will be present with me in persorming the service!
