INTRODUCTION.

Tim empire of Alexander the Great had reduced the East under
the influence of Hellenic sway and Hellenie taste. Though divided, it
had now lasted one hundred and sorty-sour years in the hands of
his successors. Whilst Alexander was winning his battles in Asia,
the duel sor the leadership of Italy was being fought by the Romans
and Samnites. We have seen that the year 266 irc. found them masters
of all Italy. In two years more the course of events made it neces-
sary for them to pass from their hitherto merely Italian policy and
develope a navy, which was sure to lead to a policy of more direct
aggression. The baptism of fire through which Hannibal made the
fertile provinces of Italy pass in the Second Punic WVar, was only a
prelude to the entry of Rome into the contest'for the leadership of
the world. In spreading her power eastward she found herself op-
posed not by one united empire, but by the scattered legions which
Alexander had bequeathed to the marshals of his empire. Regum
viribus reges oppugnare was an easy policy for a republic which had
successfully wrestled in the Second Punic War with the genius of
Hannibal and the resources of Carthage. In the First Macedonian
War, Philip, then (213-205 Rc.) King of Macedonia, had acted with
such laxness that the two powers can hardly be considered to have
matched their forces at all; the Second had been but a flash in the
pan. Eighteen years had since elapsed, during which Philip had
shewn the greatest calmness and perseverance in building up his king-
dom and preparing it for that conflict which sooner or later was sure
to be necessary. If he had displayed in his first war half the per-
severance which he then shewed in preparing sor this struggle which
he was not destined to carry through. he would not have died (179
mc.) despairing and broken—hearted. As it was, he lest behind him
vast resources and a kingdom on which all the patriots of Greece looked
with eager expectation as the representative of their nationality; he
lest behind him too a son Perseus, who, equally imperious‚ equally un-
scrupulous, was more steady and persevering than his father. All the
