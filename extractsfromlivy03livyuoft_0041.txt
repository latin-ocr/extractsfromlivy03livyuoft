THE MACEDONIAN WAR.

-13.c. 170.

1. THE THIRD YEAR OF THE WAR. ac. 170—169.

l. 1. successoris. Q. Marcius Philippus, who had been consul
seventeen years before, when he had given his name to a glen in Liguria
where he was disgracefully defeated. His appointment now was owing
to his having stayed with Perseus in Macedonia, and consequently
knowing the country.

adventu. Embarking at Brindisi he had arrived via Corfu at
Actium, whence he made his way through Ambracia to Palaepharsalus
in Thessaly.

1. 2. cum. In some instanees an ablative of manner, not qualified
by an adjective or genitive dependent on it, may be used with or without
‘ cum.' Thus we can say ‘ clamore’ or ‘cum clamore '; ‘silentio ' or
‘ cum silentio! But as a rule ‘ cum ' should be used when the ablative .
is unqualified. ‘ Cum dolore‚' ‘ cum fide,‘ ⁶ cum cura,' are better than
‘dolore,’ ‘fide‚’ ‘cura‚' respectively. On the other hand ‘vi‚' ‘iure,'
‘inim-ia,' ‘ vitio,' and others are used quite adverbially. Latin Grammar¹‚

ornato. Aulus Hostilius (the subject of ‘ processit’) had received
the army in such a bad condition from Crassus, that he was obliged to
employ his whole year of generalship in mere military reorganization.
‘In full marching condition.’

l. 4. parricidio. Used of any unnatural murder. Perseus had in·
duced his father Philip to poison his elder brother Demetrius as being
too Roman in his tendencies. Philip dying soon afterwards, Livy hints
by the words ‘mors peropportuna Perseo' that he too died of foul
play.

l. 5. post only governs ‘ scelere partum regnum.¹ Latin uses a past
participle from a desire to avoid abstract nouns. Translate ‘ after his
criminal assumption of the crown.' Compare ‘ Prusiam regem suspectum
Romanis receptus Hannibal faciebat‚' ‘the reception of Hannibal
made Prusias an object of suspicion ' (Liv. xxxix. 51). Cf. l. 185.
