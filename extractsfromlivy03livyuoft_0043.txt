I. THE THJRD YEAR OF THE WAR. 29

Madvig thinks that ‘srumentum’has fallen out of the text from the
similarity of the sound to ‘menstruuin.' But why should not Livy
have omitted it for the same reasons which Madvig imagines to have
affected the copyist ⁴?

1. 21. die . . . eonsilium. The whole sentence is an extreme illus-
tration of the way in which Livy piles his sentences with ablative
absolutes and participial or adverbial clauses. Break it up in trans-
lation. ‘The praetor was let g0, and ten days aster taking over the
command of the army the consul changed his quarters. The soldiers
had been ordered to bring with them, &c. The consul had not
proceeded more than one day⁷s journey,’ &c. In translating such
sentences as these into Latin again, the practised eye at once picks out
‘ consul ’ as the principal subject of one long Latin sentence. In Froude's
History of England‚ vol. vii, p. 153, we have the following sentences:
‘ Elizabeth was at times restive under the false part she had to play;
and she was bringing herself to face the necessity of more deeisive
action. On the 3rd ofNovember a tournament was held at Greenwich,
in which Lord Robert and Lord Hunsdon held the lists. The French
ambassador was in Elizabeth's box. She asked him if there were news
from Scotland.' In Latin this would be all one sentence.

‘profectusss inserted in some texta seems tautological. ‘ He started
ten days aster receiving conduct of the army and removed the camp]
Quintilian remarks on Livy's μακρολογία in expressions like this, as
‘ retro domum unde venerant abierunt?

l. 24. summotis. The ‘ iis' seems to point to a change of case:
hence some read ‘convocatos duces,’ govemed by iussisset. ‘ He caused
them to go aside and consulted the council as to which road he should
make for in preference!

1. 25. Pythoum, or Pythium, see map.

l. 26. duxerat. Here of the general, before of the guide.

1. 28. communis. ‘ Common to all three routes.' The second route
lay most to the West, and would have carried them away from their
fleet; the third was occupied by the Macedonian troops ; the first was
a compromise between the two.

l. 33. praemitti. The army had halted between Azorus and Do-
liche. In order to reach Lapathus they would have to march SE.

l. 36. Ceterum. ‘ For the rest' like ἀλλά. ‘But the way was so
steep‚ so rough and broken, that in two days' space they who were
sent before, though they were in light marching order, had much ado to
march fifteen miles, when they lodged and rested.' An ordinary day’s
march sor an army sully equipped was twenty miles. Note the position
of ‘ aegre,' which really belongs to ‘ confeet0,' and compare ‘ multitudo
prope numero exercitum aequabat?
