viii INTR ODUCTION.

empire to republic was simply effected by the change of ministry at
the beginning of the year. As soon as it was known that the choice
of the burgesses had fallen on Lucius Aemilius Paulus, the son of
the martyr of Cannae, it was obvious that a strong government was
contemplated. Seldom was it that a man of so humble means was
elected consul a second time. Seldom was it, it may be added, that
a man of so humble means did not make himself the richer for his
first consulship. But he was one of the few Romans of that age to
whom one coultl not osser money, and, although he was a striet
general of the old school, he was a man of such culture that his
march through Greece was a tour ot inspection os works of art.
what he was, however, and what he did, will best appear in the
course of the following pages. Is after his victory he abandoned the
humane principles which had governed the earlier part of his lise, he
will not be the last person who has doubted in the weakness os old
age the enthusiastic theories of his more hopeful manhood‚ and con·
tradicted in action the less biassed judgment of a strong youth. The
selfish hurry with which old age, not content to wait‚ tries to reap
all the laureis of one victory in a short life is well known. Hence
he acted cruelly, and in crushing Grec-ce crushed what he loved best
in Rome. A strong united Greece would have been the best guarantee
sor Rome of a higher development such as Paulus would have wished
most. But the ancient world, it has been well said, knew nothing os
a balance of power, and so every nation which attained internal unity
strove to crush or weaken its neighbour. Otherwise the union of
Grcece under the northern kingdom of Macedonia might very well
have been tried, as in our days, with the assistance of the railway
and the telegraph‚ we have seen the practical Piedmontese insuse
new vigour into the dukedom of Tuscany and the kingdom of

Naplcs.
