III. L. AEMILIUS PAULUS. ’39

l. 234: quidem, μέν in Greek. Translate, ‘As sor that,’ say they,
‘we shall take knowledge thereof personally when we are arrived, but
now sor this time have you brought with you in ready money according
to bargain what is to be divided,’ ὅτε.

l. 236. ecquid, ‘Whether.’ So Hor. Ep. i. xviii. 82, ‘ Ecquid ad te
post paullo ventura pericula sentis? ’

l. 238. abi renuntia ergo. Madvig would read ‘abire nuntiare-
que iubet‚' objecting to (1) the position of ‘ ergo,’ (2) the tense of ‘ac-
cepissent‚‘ where we should expect ‘ acceperint’ or ‘ acceperimus.’ But
against (1) compare Plautus ‘tene me, amplectere ergo? 1t is to be
confessed, however, that ‘ accessissent ' can only be explained by a mix-
ture of constructious between the direct ‘ abi inquit’ and ‘ abire iussit.’

ΙΙΙ. L. AEMILIUS PAULUS. B.C. 169.

Every Roman citizen, besides having the name of his gens, which
generally terminated in ‘ -ius,’ had a praenomen peculiar to him as an
individual. Of these praenomina there were about thirty. In addition
to these two names, those families which had specially distinguished
themselves often took a cognomen from some remarkable event in the
life of the founder of the branch of the gens to which they belonged,
e. g. Brutus, Cato, Naso, Torquatus. Many Romans had a second
cognomen or agnomen, which did not, like the cognomen, descend,
given as an honorary distinction, e. g. Macedonicus, Asiaticus, Africanus.
The Aemilia gens had many familiae, e. g. Scauri, Regilli, Pauli, Lepidi.
So our Howard clan or gens may be said to be divided into the families
of Norfolk, Carlisle‚ Suffolk, Wicklow, and others equally old and less
noble.

l. 241. in exitu. ‘Approaching its close.' Servilius had been
Philippus' home colleague for this year.

1. 243. crearent, deliberative subjunctive. ‘ Creare’ is properly said
of the outgoing consul.

l. 244. ut, commonly and rnore idiomatically ‘quo’ is used with
comparatives in final sentences.

l. 245. placuit, sc. ‘senatui’ ‘ It was resolvedf

l. 247. ut iam takes up the previous ‘ut’ in line 246. Translate,
‘That as soon as it was known which consul had drawn Macedonia,
they might then at once,‘ ἃς. But possibly the second ‘ut' ought to
be left out, as (1) ‘iam inde’ ought to come immediately after the
temporal clause; (2) ‘sciretur’ may possibly have given rise to the

second ‘ ut.'
l. 249. Latinas, sc. ‘ferias’ It was a great engine in the hands of
