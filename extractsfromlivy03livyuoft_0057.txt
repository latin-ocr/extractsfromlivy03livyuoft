IV. PAULUS’ MILITARY REFORMS. 43

1. 307. ever-gerent, ‘Send forth? This transitive use of ‘evergo‘
is unique: so Madvig suggests ‘ erigerent ' or ‘ egererent? The force of
the subjunctive is, ‘ Because, as he noticed,' &c.

l. 308. venae . . . miscerentur. Translate, ‘Whose veins drained
off into the sea, and so got mixed with the sea water.‘

1. 309. scaturiges. ‘ Gushing springs.' Der. ‘ scaturio‚’ ‘to gush,‘
which, like ‘ ligurio‚' has the ‘u ' long, and is therefore not to be con-
founded with the desideratives which, though derived from the future
participles, make the ‘u' short. These are rather derived from some
nouns formed like ”’ tellus, -firis.'

l. 310. liquidam. ‘Transparent.’ Opposed to ‘turbidae.’ So ‘aere
lapsa quieto radit iter liquidum,' Virg. Aen. v. 217.

l. 312. quoque. ‘ In addition to the popularity of his name?

l. 315. quod fieret. Not, as some editors take it, subject of ‘pro-
nuntiaretur,’ which would require ‘quid,' unless it meant ‘what was
going on,’ which is not the sense. This is the equivalent in oblique

. narration of ‘ quod fit.' ‘ As was the existing eustom.’

1. 316. exaudire. The infinitive represents in oblique narration the
indicative of the preamble to ‘ placere igitur? ⁴ pronuntiasset ' in l. 339
makes the construction evident.

incerto . . . faeere. ‘ So receiving an uncertain order, some
adding of themselves do more than what is commanded, others less.’
Notiee here the transition from the historie to the primary construction.
‘Fieret’ is historic; ‘imperatum sit' and the rest of the verbs are
primary.

1. 319. tribunum militum. There were six in a legion, whose
duties were to keep order in the camp and generally superintend the
legionaries. They commanded in tum as colonels of the legion.

1. 320. primo pilo. ‘The first centurion? He had the care ofthe
eagle and the right of attending the councils of the general. Every
centuria (varying from 50 to 100 men) had two centurions‚ a ‘centurio’
and an ‘ optio' or lientenant‚ who was chosen by the centurion.

‘ secretum? ‘ Without publishing it.'

l. 322. ‘ novissimum agmen.' ⁵ Rear.' ,

1. 324. etiam takes up ‘primum‚' l. 313. Translate, ‘Moreover he
brought in a new rule, and ordained,' δίο.

l. 325. enim. ‘For he said that a sentry did not,’ &c. Probably
in the eagerness to fight which Hostilius' and Philippus' inaction had
caused, the outposts had been trying to bring on a general engagement.

l. 328. erecto. ‘ Set on end.’ The scutum was four feet long.

stare. Describes the existing objectionable practice, like ‘exaudire,'
‘ facere,’ ‘oriri ' above. and ‘perstabant' ‘and ‘ vexabant' below.
galeatos. ‘ with their helmets on.'
